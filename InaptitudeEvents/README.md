Currently, only one event exists.

## Xsotan distress Signal

(Originally written for use on the Divine Reapers server, when FactionWars, Xsotan attacks and pirate attacks caused major lag on every other Avorion server.
this event served as a way for people to seek out combat, when it was less frequent due to toning down the above events.)

A group of refugees are trying to escape some xsotan attackers.
Unfortunately, the Xsotan are not just trying to destroy them,
they are trying to convert their ships.

If you respond to the event, you can kill the Xsotan attackers, but two of the
refugees will convert into Xsotan within 15-20 seconds of entering the sector.
